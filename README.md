#### WEATHER APP.

The app just displays the current weather and some additional informations such as the temperature felt, the humidity, the pressure and the wind speed. <br />

I'm using the https://ipgeolocation.io api to get the current coordonates as the geolocation api has been disabled and the openweather api to get the current weather.

It's a simple vanilla js website.
